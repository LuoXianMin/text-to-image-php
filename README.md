<h1>Basic Art Generator "Seed" Program</h1>
<p>I built this as a foundation for something that can be taken in almost any direction. It will currently take a string and print it onto an image, which is then stored (in the same folder) and displayed on the webpage using the GET method.</p>

<br>

<h3>Have a look</h3>
<p>This is the form into which you would enter a string.</p>

<br>
<p>The script in <b>art-generator.php</b> will process and generate this image</p>

<p>While it may look bland, keep in mind this program is mean to be developed upon to create something more comphrehensive.</p>

<h3>Capabilities</h3>
<p>I'm calling this project a "seed" art-generator because it can be innovated further. You can create reCAPTCHA-esque images for spam prevention, generate unique images for users, store display user emails in a photo to prevent spammers from obtaining this information, and so on.</p>

<h3>How to run this</h3>
<p>You will need Apache installed on your local machine to run PHP scripts. You can also use CLI. Check out the PHP website because they discuss almost anything you might need.</p>
