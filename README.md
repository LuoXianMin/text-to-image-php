<h1>Basic Art Generator "Seed" Program</h1>
<p>I built this as a foundation for something that can be taken in almost any direction. It will currently take a string and print it onto an image, which is then stored (in the same folder) and displayed on the webpage using a GET method.</p>

<br>

<h3>Have a look</h3>
<p>This is the form, into which you would enter the string.</p>

<br>
<p>The script in art-generator.php will process and generate this image</p>

<h3>Capabilities</h3>
<p>I'm calling this project a "seed" art-generator because it can be innovated further. You can create ReCaptcha-esque images for spam prevention, you could generate unique images for users, and so on.</p>
