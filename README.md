<h1>Text-to-image converter</h1>
<p>This project contains <strong>text-to-image.php</strong>, <strong>art-generator.php</strong> under <em>art-generator-basic</em>, and an example under <em>examples/</em>.</p>
<p>Take a string (from input or textarea) and print it onto an image, which is then stored (in the same folder). It is displayed on the same page for demonstration purposes. I have not separated the actual php, but it can be found in the <strong>text-to-image.php</strong> file. </p>
<p>text-to-image.php will take text and convert it to an image with line breaks and dynamically adjust the height. See the animation directly below.</p>
